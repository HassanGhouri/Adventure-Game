Abandoned Mall Divergence

You see 3 pathways. The left hallway has been reclaimed by foliage but there is an opening small enough to crawl through.
The hallway ahead leads down to a lit up section of the mall. The rightmost hallway is too dark to see what's ahead.
You feel uneasy. Strangley enough you hear the noises of wild animals coming from the room behind you.

As you step onto the elevator, it speeds up to an uncomfortable pace. There is no end to this descent.
You are stuck here. The thorny vines cut away at your body. You try your best to get off but the escalator's speed
stops you from moving. All hope is lost.
