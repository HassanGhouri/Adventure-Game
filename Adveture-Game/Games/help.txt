To play this game you must move between locations and interact with objects by typing one or two word commands.

Some commands are motion commands.  These will move you from room to room. Motion commands include:

UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, STRAIGHT, IN, BACK

Not all motions are possible in every room. In addition, some rooms may have "special" or "secret" motion commands.

There are other action commands in the game. These include:

COMMANDS: this will print the moves that are legal in a given room.
HELP: this will display instructions
INVENTORY: this will print your current inventory.
LOOK: this will print the description for the current room.
TAKE <object>: this will take an object from a room and place it in your inventory. Replace <object> with the name of the object to take.  The object must be present in the room in order to take it.
DROP <object>: this will drop an object in your inventory. Replace <object> with the name of the object to drop. The object must be in your inventory to drop it.
UNDO: this will undo your last fast travel move. Note it cannot be used on regular moves
MAP: this will print a map of the game. Click on a room to fast travel to it.  Note that the map will not show rooms that you have not visited or FORCED rooms.
Some paths may be blocked.  To unblock a path you may need a specific object to be in your inventory.

The Search Button is available in certain rooms. Clicking it will open up a mini-game where you will have ten seconds to find
the item named on the top of the GUI. Clicking on it within the 10 seconds will add the item to your inventory. 
These special search items can be used in certain rooms to unlock a secret ending. Please allow up to 10 seconds for the item to be 
added to your inventory.

The game is over when your player reaches the VICTORY room, or when your player DIES.
